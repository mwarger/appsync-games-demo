This is the demo and accompanying slides for "Rethinking REST Practices with GraphQL"

This uses AppSync as the backend, and was provisioned using [AWS-Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/).

To get started, take a look at the `schema.graphql` file located at `./amplify/backend/api/gameapi/`.

## Usage

- run `yarn install` (or `npm install`)
- run `yarn start`

## Types

- `src/API.ts` contains the types that were generated for the queries using `amplify codegen types`
